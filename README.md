I am Şakir Mehmetoğlu 🧔

Currently, I live in Istanbul. I have been interested in web development since 2007 and I have been working professionally since 2011.

I have been working on e-commerce projects for about 6+ years, but throughout my career I have developed HMS (Hotel Management System), CRM (Customer Relationship Management), Travel Agency Softwares, Airline Reservation Systems and many different projects. In addition, I have developed projects of public institutions on a part-time and full-time basis in a public institution for about 5 years.
### 🤖 &nbsp;About Me

👨🏻‍💻 &nbsp; I'm a Computer Engineer\
🌱 &nbsp;I am interested in e-commerce systems development, application security, software architectures and the use of different technologies together.\
🚀 ️&nbsp;In my free time, when I am at the computer, I do research on technological issues that I am interested in. When I get away from the computer, I often use my bike and especially go on nature trips. Being away from the city center relaxes me.\
🥰️ &nbsp;In addition, I try to provide training on topics I know in environments such as Discord, and we develop projects with junior developers. I'm happy to see them getting better.
